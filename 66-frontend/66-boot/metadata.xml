	This package is the boot@ module, which is essential for booting a system with <pkg>sys-apps/66</pkg>.

	A module is a type of (mandatorily instantiated) service which contains a group of internal services and a "configure" script.
	The script analyzes the env-vars and the system state to enable and configure an optimal set of services as needed.
	The module itself can depend on external services, but services inside the module are self-contained.
	It provides immense flexibility and customizability;
	The scriptwriter can write some regexes using the central frontend file and it will be automatically applies across the services and scripts.
	The "configure" script allows you to write your own logic on "What to do?"; While exposing all knobs and tunables to the user via the EnvFile and the frontend regexes.
	It is the most advanced feature of 66.
